# Ion Compiler
This is my implementation of Per Vognsen's programming language Ion from his    
[Bitwise](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU94OURih-CiP4WxKSMt3UcwMSDM3aTtX) series. I learned an enormous amount from his series and by struggling   
through writing my own compiler. I am grateful for his generosity in sharing   
his knowledge. I highly recommend you check out Per's [original implementation](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise).  
This is my first attempt at writing a compiler and my version is no doubt much  
lower quality.
