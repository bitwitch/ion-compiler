Resolution / Binding

When resolving a declaration (e.g. a struct), there are two possible scenarios:
1. we encountered the definition
  - resolve the symbol AND complete the type
2. we encountered some other usage
  - resolve the symbol, but only complete types if we actually need the 
    complete type at this moment

Resolving shit


What does it mean to "resolve" a symbol?

there are two kinds of "resolution" happening
1 discovering dependencies
2 type completion

a dependency on a particular symbol does not necissarily mean it must be ordered
before you, only if it trys to use the symbol in a way that it needs to know the
full definition of the thing is the type completed and the symbol put into the
ordered symobol list


concrete example, symbol of kind SYM_VAR
- discover the type of the var sym and either create a new type or associate it
  with the already created canonical version of that type
- discover what symbols that the var sym depends on
  (resolve the rhs expression)
- make sure that the rhs expression (if it exists) matches the type of the lhs
- if the rhs is a constant, evaluate it and store that somewhere
- detect cycles
  i.e. var x: int = x;


struct x { v: Vec3; }

SYM_TYPE
struct, union
- create a new type and associate it with the symbol
- iterate over the fields and discover dependencies
  (resolve the type of each field)
- make sure fields have unique names
- ensure there are some fields at all
- ensure no duplicate definitions




structs and unions, the moment a symbol is created for them, they are resolved
in other words they begin life resolved (SYM_RESOLVED)
however they are not put into the ordered symbols list, until they are COMPLETED

Order Independent Declarations

The simple, but shallow approach of just ordering declarations based on walking
their dependencies failed. The reason was the dependecies that were only on a pointer
to a thing and not its value. There are cases like the following where it falls
apart:

const x = sizeof(*p);
var p: T*;
struct T { ... }

Here p only depends on T through a pointer so it does not have to be ordered
before it. However x depends on p and deferences it so actually depends on T as
a value. This sort of "transitivity" issue can not be solved with the simple
shallow walking of dependencies.


The new approach is the following:

- Parse a bunch of declarations
- create a new symbol for each decl, and add it to a symbol table
  (a symbol is basically a package level binding)
- iterate through all the symbols and recursively resolve everything
  adding them to a list of ordered symbols
- 


resolving a typespec is turning the syntactic typespec into a semantic type

structs and union types will always start out as TYPE_INCOMPLETE, then only when
in a situation where the complete type is explicitly needed do we finish
"completing" the type


2023-03-06
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Order Independent Declarations

1. Create a symbol table which maps names to declarations

2. iterate over the symbol table and order the declarations

3. Order:
   if ordered, return the ordered decl
   if unordered, set to ordering and recursively order it
   if ordering, there is a cycle, print error

Lexing
- transform a stream of characters into a stream of tokens

Parsing
- transform a stream of tokens into an AST
- An ast node corresponds to a grammar production rule

Resolving Symbols/Entities
- order independent declarations
- cyclic dependency detection
- constant expression evaluation
- type checking/inference



Ion Compiler High Level Algorithm
1. parse a bunch of declarations corresponding to a package
2. install entities for each of them (entity => package level binding)
3. go through all entities and resolve each one recursively


resolving a typespec is turning the syntactic typespec into a semantic type

incomplete types - aggregate types begin their life as incomplete types. as
resolution proceeds, types are sort of lazily resolved where fields are only
resolved at the time of first use, 

there are two types of resolving going on: declaration level ordering and stuff,
and then type level dependency resolution

A "Type" is an interned, canonical version of a type that can be compared
directly with pointers 



difference in Type and Typespec?
